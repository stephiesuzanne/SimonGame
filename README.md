Play a game of Simon.

Demo link:

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:

A sound and "light up" animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button.

If a wrong button is pressed, the game ends.
